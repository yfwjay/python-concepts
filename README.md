#  Python Concepts Refresher

Welcome to my **Python Programming Refresher Course** repository!  
This repo documents my journey as I revisit and strengthen my understanding of core Python programming concepts — week by week.

---

##  About This Repo
This repository is organized into weekly folders.  
Each folder contains:
- A **README.md** summarizing everything I learned that week.
- **Python scripts (.py)** for the topics I practiced.
- Examples, exercises, and notes to reinforce each concept.

---

## 🗂️ Folder Structure

- week1/ → Python basics (variables, data types, control flow)
- week2/ → Functions, lists, and tuples
- week3/ → Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- README.md → Main documentation file



Each week has its own branch (e.g. `week_one`, `week_two`, etc.) for version control and tracking progress.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Refresh my knowledge of Python fundamentals  
- Write clean and well-documented Python code  
- Build confidence for future projects using Python  

---
