Also for json files we will also do the same.
Try to manipulate json files using the different modes: read , write and append . THIS ARE THE MOST COMMON MODES

RULES OF THUMB TO KNOW WHICH FILE HANDLING METHOD TO USE

1. Txt files

-> They are just sentences or lines

2. Json files

-> They look like dictionaries or has levels

3. Csv files

-> They can be opened using an excel sheet. Looks like tables(rows and columns)
