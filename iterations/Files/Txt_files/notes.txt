I'll be trying to read , append , edit contents in a txt file

We create a txt file and use modes such as read , append etc

Then write contents inside the file we have created.



There are certain situations where one would want to specify the path of where you want to create a file

2 ways: importing pathlib or The string way

1.Pathlib

So you specify the directory then the file.

Example: In our case:

STEP 1
from pathlib from path
STEP 2 // SPECIFY THE FOLDER

folder = path("C:\Users\Kxbuga\Desktop\python-concepts\iterations\Files")

STEP 3 // SPECIFY THE LOCATION OF THE FILE YOU WANT TO CREATE

file = folder / "name of the txt file"

STEP 4 // ENSURE THAT THE FOLDER (OPTIONAL BUT SAFE)

folder.mkdir(parents = "TRUE" , exist_ok = True)

STEP 5 // NOW USE THE OPEN METHOD

with open("file_path" , "w") as file:
    CONTINUE AS WE NORMALLY DO


2.The string way

This method is where we prefix the path with r

path = r"C:\Users\Kxbuga\Desktop\python-concepts\iterations\Files\details.txt"

with open("path" , "w") as file:
    CONTINUE AS WE NORMALLY DO
