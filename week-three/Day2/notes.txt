CREATING A SIMPLE BMI CALCULATOR APP 

1.All I need to know is the folmulae for calculating the BMI.

Formulae is BMI = weight / height ** 2

Divide weight by the square of height.

But this time I'll be using a function and we pass in the paramteres weight and height.

Earlier in the previous week we did a simple calculator project that adds 2 numbers but at that time we happened to use variables and then we use a decision structure the if-else statement.
