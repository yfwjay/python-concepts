LAMBDA FUNCTIONS AND RETURN STATEMENTS

1. LAMBDA FUNCTIONS

This is a quick throw-away function with no name.
We use it when we want to perform a certain operation quickly and then forget about it.

2.RETURN STATEMENTS

Here we check the use of return statements in a function and how it differenciates from a print statement.

When we include a return statement in a function we store that value and we can reuse it

Otherwise in a function when we use a print statement this means when that function is executed it cant be reused. 

Python script return_statemnt.py will help undestand return statement AND
Pythin script lambda_function.py will help understand use of lambda functions.
