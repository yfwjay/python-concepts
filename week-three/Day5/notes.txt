Today we will be building a CLI To-do list application

CLI - Command Line Application.

In this project we will try to impliment what we have been learning from:
loops , functions , writing modular code , lists etc.

But the main concept here is to understand how we impliment writing modular code.

It was a lesson in the previous day where we talked about using utility functions when creating functions to impliment modularity.

The folder below objectives contains three python scripts tryiing to impliment what we have have been learning


ABOUT THE PROJECT.

1. We want the user to be able to enter a task , be able to view that task  , complete that task as done ,  delete a task and lastly be able to exit the application when all is done.

2.We will intriduce the user to the CLI Application thats the purpose of the python script menu.py.

3.In the tasks.py we will define what each task shall be doing.

4.Lastly in the main.py file thats where we define the functionality by calling our utility functions
