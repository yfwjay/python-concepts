How to write clean and modular python code

modular - Breaking a large program into small parts 
It is advisable that we write code that is not sphagetti.

So how do we do that.

Thats where functions comes in. Functions allows us to write reusable , clean code.
One function does a specific purpose and when we want to use it we call the function.

To write a function for best practices we have to use return keyword for example inside the function.
Using a retun keyword is a best practice when writing functions i=as it makes the function reusable since we store the value unlike when we use the print statement.


Utility functions

This are functions that you can reuse and you happen to call it in another file.

We just use from file_name use function

We tell our file that there is a certain function in a certain location retrieve it and lets use that method.

See python script to understand the difference between modular and non-modular code.
