TUPLES AND SETS IN PYTHON

1.Tuples

A tuple is a collection of ordered , immutable list of items.
We use parenthesis() to define lists.

A tuple is used as its faster than a list. Can also be used as a key in a dictionary.

I learned how to access , slice and unpack a tuple.

2.Sets

A set is a collection of mutable , un-ordered and non-duplicate collection of items.
We use curly braces{} to define a set.

A set is used when we want to return non-duplicate values and also membership testing.

Sets also supports sets theory like union , intersection , difference etc.

NOTE BETTER
SETS DO NOT SUPPORT INDEXING AND SLICING.
