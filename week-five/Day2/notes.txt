Error Handling(Try except) and Debugging in python

Types of errors to expect in Python.
    1.Syntax error
    Arises when you dont follow the normal convection of writing python code. Eg : missing parenthesis in a print statement , missing quotes in strings etc.

    2.Runtime error
    Arises when you try running your code but it returns an error despite being correct in terms of Syntax. Eg: Dividing a number by 0.

To avoid this types of errors will be using (try-except) to identify this errors.

try clause: It contains the code that might contain the error.
except clause: It contains the code that will be printed to the user in case of an error.

DEBUGGING 
This is the process of finding and fixing errors.

We also talked about:
1.Tracebacks
2.Modularity
3.Break Points

See python scripts below to expalin the error handling and debugging.
