OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING(OOP)
This is a programming paradigm that uses objects to create programs.
Each Object has a data and a behaviour(DB)


Class 
-> This is a blue-print for creating objects.

Object
-> This is an instance of a class.

When designing classes in python by default we have:

1.A default constructor method.

The constructor method has a name __init__ and a parameter self. eg: def __init__(self):

After that you can go ahead and add your paramters.
Inside the default constructor thats where we define our data.

Then now one can go ahead and create their normal methods the way we usually create functions.

OBJECT
To create an object we MUST call the class and then store the class in a variable. Now the variable is our object.

To execute the methods we call our object and then add the method. eg class.method


KEY-TAKEAWAYS.
1. Definition of a class and an object.
2. Classes should always start with a capital letter as the 1st letter.
3. Classes have a default constructor method with a paramter self.
4. Inside the constructor method is where we define our data.
5. When we create a function inside a class we call it a method.
