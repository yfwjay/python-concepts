NOTE-TAKING APP
Ill be building a note-taking app with the following features.
1.Adding a note
2.Viewing your notes
3.Deleting a note
4.Exiting the application


Those are the basic functionlities. You can go ahead and extend your application with features such as: timestamp , searching for a particular note , editing a note etc

Some of the things I'll be implimenting:

1.Functions 
2.Try and except handling
3.reading and writing txt files 
4.list methods
5.decision structures such as for loops , while loop , if else conditions etc


See the folder note_taking_app for how the project was implimented.
