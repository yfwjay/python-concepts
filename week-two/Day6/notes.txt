Today I learnt about the following keywords which are used in loops:
1.Break
2.Continue

1.Break
Break keyword is used when we want o exit a loop when a certain condition has been met.

2.Continue 
Used when we want to skip a certain iteration.

Python scripts shows the break and continue keywords in action.
