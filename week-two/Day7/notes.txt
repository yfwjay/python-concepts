Today I'll be building an number guessing game.

So this mini project is to trya n impliment the lessons I've learnt this whole week.It includes use of iterations , break and continue statements.

HOW IT WORKS
1. We have 1st to import a module called random. This module randomly creates random numbers.
2.We create a variable and pass the module and its method randint(). Inside the parameters we pass the range eg 1 to 10.
3.Since we are gonna use a while loop we must include an intializer.
4.We introduce the user to the game by what the game does.
5.Since we don't want to exit the loop at any instance unless the condition is true we use the while true:
6.We include our conditions here.

The python script below includes the number guessing game.
