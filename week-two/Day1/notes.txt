OPERATIONS AND EXPRESSIONS IN PYTHON

An expression is any piece of code that returns a value.

OPERATIONS
I've learnt the different types of opearators we have.
    a) Comparison opearators
        They compare one variable from another and always return a boolean.Examples include: > , < , >= , <= , =
    b) Logical opearators
        They put some logic into our code. Examples of Logical operators:
        Logical or , logical and and logical not opearator.
    c) Assignment opearators
        Update values of that varible. Example of Assignment operators.
            += updates a value by a certain value and reassigns the value of the variable
            -= updates a value by subtraction and reassigns the value of the variable.


NOTE BETTER

I also learnt the following new things.
    a) modulus(%) = Returns the reminder after division
    b) flow division(//) = Returns an integer despite even the division having decimal plaes/
    c) power(**) = raises a certain value certain number of times.
