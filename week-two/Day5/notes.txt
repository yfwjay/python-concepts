Today I learnt about While loops as a type of loop

Unlike for loops where it used when we know the definite number of times we want to iterate something a while loop solves this.

A while loop can be used when we want to iterate sth for an infinite number of times.

You shouldnt impliment this as its a never ending process and could cause you to reset ur machine due to hanging.

So thats a disadvantageous trait of while loop.

But below are python scripts of while loop in implimentation.
