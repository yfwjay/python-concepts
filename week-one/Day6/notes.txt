MINI-PROJECT

Today I'm going to be doing a mini project of what i have learnt in the last 5 days

The project is about: REVERSING A STRING.

STEPS.

1.Allow the user to enter a string and store that string ina variable.
2.Reverse that string using either slicing or loops
3.Print the original string and the sliced strings.
