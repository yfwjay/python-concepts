STRING OPERATORS AND METHODS

In string Operators we will discuss about Concatenation and Repetition

a)Concatenation
Fancy word for adding. We add strings together. Example:

greetings = 'Hello, How are you?"
reply = 'Im good'

to combine the two strings we use plus(+) sign

example in usage print(greetings + " " + reply) the "" is for spacing. Python script in the folder Day 4 shows a practical example.

b)Repetition
There may come an instance where we would want to print a string multiple times.
We use the * sign.

Example: print(reply * 3) Print Im good 3 times.

1.upper() prints string in upper case

4.strip() Removes spaces from a string
5.replace() Repalce a word with another
6.split() Seperates words from each other and saves them in a list.
7.len() To check the length of our string and it starts from 1
