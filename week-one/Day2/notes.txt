VARIABLES AND DATA TYPES

-> A Variable is a name that represents/ refers to a value stored in memory
 
HOW TO DECLARE VARIABLES

variable_name = Value   FOR EXAMPLE:  name = 'James' age = 10 age_string = '12'

DATATYPES
This tells us which type our value is . For example:

-> integer  Represents a number.
-> string   Represents a word like a name in quotation.
-> float    An integer with a decimal point.

Type-Casting

This is what we call type conversion convert from one datatype to another.

Example: age = 10
         age_float = float(age)

Printing DATATYPES

We use the the function type()  . 

Example:

        age = 20 
        print(type(age))

INPUT FROM PROGRAMMER

To allow one to enter their own inputs we use the keyword input()

NOTE BETTER

We seperate strings from variables during printing using commas

Practice
-> Create 2 python scripts
-> One for what i learnt
-> The other for practice like an assignment
