INDEXING AND SLICING STRINGS IN PYTHON

HOW IT WORKS
Indexing starts from 0.
Example: print("Hello) H is in index 0 , e = 1 , l = 2 and so on.

The word hello starts from index o to index 4.

How do we incorporate Indexing

We use Square brackets []
Example: greetings = 'Hello'   print(greetings[0])  

When we run the python script the output should be g as g is in index 0.


SLICING

In slicing we have to specify both the starting index and ending index.

We use same example:  print(greetings[0:3])

0: 3 means we want to print items in index 0 to 3 so the output will be gre.

NB print(greetings[-1]) we are printing the last element inside our variable greetings.

Spaces are also accounted as part of the index see python script greetings.py
