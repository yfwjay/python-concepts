STRING FORMATTING

Earlier we learnt on concatenation. 
In that area it was about adding strings together and for formatting we had to add commas after every string.

This is tiresome especially when you have large strings.This is where string formatting comes around.

In string formatting we will specifically deal with f-strings.

F-strings
In python f-strings makes it easier to format our strings.

How we incorporate f-strings

Assume we have 3 variables and inside the varibles we have repective values: name , age and occupation.

when printing we apply f-strings as follows:

print(f"My name is " {name} . I'm {age} years old and I'm a {occupation})

See python script f-string.py in practicality.
